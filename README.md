🤖 AI Career Guidance Chatbot (Mini Generative AI Project)

This is a small, learning-focused Generative AI project built to understand how Large Language Model (LLM) APIs can be integrated into a simple, real-world application.

The goal of this project is not research or model training, but to learn and implement the basics of applied GenAI system design.

🎯 Purpose of This Project

Learn how to work with LLM APIs (GROQ + LLaMA)

Understand prompt engineering

Build a simple interactive AI application

Practice clean code structure and deployment readiness

🧠 What I Learned

Through this mini project, I learned:

How to integrate pre-trained LLMs using APIs

Basics of prompt engineering for structured responses

How to control model behavior using temperature

How conversational AI works at a system level

How to build a minimal web interface using Gradio

How to manage environment variables securely

How real-world GenAI tools are assembled, not trained

🛠️ What I Implemented

A simple career guidance chatbot

Structured prompts to generate consistent responses

Support for multiple LLaMA models

A lightweight Gradio-based UI

Basic conversation history handling

🧩 Tech Stack
